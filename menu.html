                The restaurant is located in the heart of Lisbonâ€™s business
                district, overlooking the entire city and surrounded by lush
                gardens. More than simply a restaurant, Eleven is a place of
                culture and art, both at the table and beyond it. The
                architecture of the purpose-built building is modern, minimalist
                and organic, using natural materials like wood and decorative
                stones, and boasting enormous glass windows that open towards
                Lisbon and the river Tagus. The restaurant witnesses
                metamorphosis during the day as it adapts to the changing effect
                of the outside light and the views over Lisbon.
